Logistics management: store replenishment
=========================================
Logistics is about getting the right product, to the right customer, in the right quantity, in the right condition, at the right place, at the right time, and at the right cost (the seven Rs of Logistics).

In this case we need to calculate the stores assignment of a given product by considering the store demands, the transportation costs, the margin and the total stock of the product in the warehouse.
The goal is to maximize the benefit by considering the demand, the margin and the transportation costs.

More specifically,

Given:
- A list of stores s1, s2, s3, ...
- A product demand for each store
- A transportation cost per product unit for each store
- A margin per product unit for each store
- An initial stock in the warehouse

The goal is:
- Maximize the benefit of sending the units of product to each store.

Restrictions are:
- Not to overlap the maximum amount of stock in the warehouse.

Code snippet with data
- See ass_replenishment.py

Additional exercise
In many real cases the product demand is not well known. Consider now the demand follows a Poisson distribution P(l), where l is the previous value of demand (the expected demand for each store). Reformulate the problem with this new situation.
